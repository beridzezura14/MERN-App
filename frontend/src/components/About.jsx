                        MERN is a popular full-stack web development stack made up of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It allows developers to build modern, dynamic web applications using JavaScript for both frontend and backend. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, Express.js is a web framework for Node.js, React handles the user interface, and Node.js runs the server-side logic. MERN is known for its efficiency, scalability, and being fully JavaScript-based, which helps streamline development. Itâ€™s widely used for building everything from simple websites to large, production-ready applications.
